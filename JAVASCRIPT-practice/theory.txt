1) A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

2) The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

Fixed values
Variable values
Fixed values are called Literals.

Variable values are called Variables.

3) JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
4) Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".

Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:

5) Note
Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.

This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.

6)JavaScript and Camel Case
Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

Hyphens:

first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

Underscore:

first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):

FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

Lower Camel Case:

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.

7) 4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
Using var
Using let
Using const
Using nothing

8) Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.

The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.

9) in a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.

In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.

In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.

10)In an object method, this refers to the object.
Alone, this refers to the global object.
In a function, this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

11) six other escape sequence characters are\b	Backspace
\f	Form Feed
\n	New Line
\r	Carriage Return
\t	Horizontal Tabulator
\v	Vertical Tabulator
