## About Github

Being a developer requires you to use many tools. Writing code is a complex task, and using the right tools can make it significantly easier. If you’ve been reading about coding and programming for a while, you must have heard of Github. It’s one of the must-haves for any programmer.

Github allows teams to collaborate on projects and offers a platform where developers from all over the globe can work. It is the perfect place for modern developers. In the following points, you’ll learn what Github is, how to use Github, and how you can become an expert programmer who is well-acquainted with Github and other related tools.

#### What is Github?

Github is a dynamic platform that allows developers to store their code and collaborate on projects. It is a hosting platform where you can store your code in their server in the form of folders and files called repositories. You can also track your code there seamlessly and, if you want, share your code with others

Github is an open-source version control platform. It allows programmers to work on projects together and share their code quickly whenever necessary. Managing collaboration coding projects on Github is also significantly easy as it shows the source of the collection of all the related files and spreads it across them

It is a cloud-based solution and allows you to host Git repositories. To properly understand Github, it would be best to understand version control and Git.

#### What is Version Control?

Version control allows you to track and manage all the changes made to a software project’s code. It’s a crucial aspect of any software project – as a project becomes bigger, it becomes essential to have version control.

Consider the case of Amazon. Amazon is a massive project. If a developer wanted to make changes to a specific aspect of Amazon’s source code, it wouldn’t be good to edit the source code directly. First, it would affect the user experience and expose the entire platform to potential bugs and troubleshooting attempts

Instead of editing the official source code, the developer can utilize version control. Version control allows you to branch and merges the code, ensuring that the source code doesn’t suffer from the troubles we just discussed above.

#### What is Git?

Git is a software solution that allows you to track changes in any set of files. It is an open-source distributed version control system. Linus Torvalds is also the creator of the popular operating system, kernel (Linux) ithub solves this problem by providing you with an easy-to-use interface. Even if you don’t have a lot of coding experience, you can start using Github right away. Some people even use Github to work on non-tech projects as well such as writing books

Github is a for-profit company, and it makes its revenue by offering commercial plans to organizations and hosting private code repositories

#### Why use Github?

Github offers many advantages that have cemented its position as a must-have tool for any developer or programmer. Its super-simple interface allows professionals with varying experience levels and expertise to collaborate on projects. Moreover, it facilitates collaboration and version control on large projects. It hosts numerous open-source projects in different sectors, including research, marketing, healthcare, etc.

On top of all this, Github is also an industry staple. Most employers use Github in their organization to handle version control and collaborate on projects. Hence, it would be great to have Github listed on your resume if you want to pursue a tech career. Knowing how to use Github can make it quite easy to kickstart your tech career.

GitHub is an open-source version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. GitHub, which is delivered through a software as a service (SaaS) business model, was started in 2008 and was founded on Git, an open-source code management system created by Linus Torvalds to make software builds faster.

Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. It allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers. GitHub facilitates social coding by providing a Web interface to the Git code repository and management tools for collaboration. GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public repositories for free but it charges for private repositories, offering three types of paid plans. Each public or private repository contains all of a project's files as well as each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

GitHub can be thought of as a serious social networking site for software developers. Members can follow each other, rate each other's work, receive updates for specific projects and communicate publicly or privately. Three important terms used by developers in GitHub are fork, pull request and merge. A fork is simply a repository that has been copied from one member's account to another member's account. Forks allow a developer to make modifications without affecting the original code. If the developer would like to share the modifications, she can send a pull request to the owner of the original repository. If after reviewing the modifications, the original owner would like to pull the modifications into the repository, she can accept the modifications and merge them with the original repository.

Because GitHub is so intuitive to use and its version control tools are so use for collaboration, non-programmers have also begun to use GitHub to work on document-based and multi-media projects.
